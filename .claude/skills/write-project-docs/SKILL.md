  Write, review, and maintain the root-level project documentation — README.md, SECURITY.md,
  CONTRIBUTING.md — for Agora backend services. Use this skill whenever scaffolding a new
  project's docs, updating an existing README/SECURITY/CONTRIBUTING (new env var, new badge,
  new client section, security contact change), or adding sections like client usage or
  Docker examples. Does NOT cover CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (standard Contributor Covenant, copy
  verbatim) or in-source code comments (use document-code).
---

# Project Docs

This skill governs the three root-level Markdown files that describe a project to external
readers: `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`. These files are the first thing
visitors see; they set expectations for usage, security contact, and how to contribute. They
must be accurate, scannable, and consistent across all Agora services.

The skill has two modes:

- **Scaffold** — the file does not exist yet (new project). Generate from the templates in
  this skill, substituting project-specific inputs.
- **Update** — the file exists. Edit the relevant section in place. Never overwrite a whole
  file when the ask is to change one section.

Separate concerns:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — **not managed by this skill.** Copy the Contributor Covenant
  verbatim from <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.md>
  when setting up a new project and do not edit further.
- `document-code` — governs doc comments inside source files (Go, SQL, TS, etc.), not these
  project-level Markdown files.

---

## Phase 1: Collect Required Inputs

Before scaffolding a new file, ask the user for the inputs below. When running in **update**
mode, only ask for the inputs that are relevant to the section being edited.

Collect them in a single message rather than asking one question at a time.

### 1.1 Always required

| Input                | Example                     | Default for Agora        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Project display name | `JSON Keys service`         | (ask)                    |
| Repo path (org/repo) | `a-novel/service-json-keys` | `a-novel/<service-slug>` |
| Main branch          | `master`                    | `master`                 |

### 1.2 Required for README.md

| Input               | Example                                                   | Default / Fallback                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main CI workflow    | `main.yaml`                                               | `main.yaml`                                                                                              |
| Codecov graph token | `almKepuGQE` (public token, safe to commit)               | Omit the `?token=…` query parameter entirely and leave a `TODO(project-docs)` comment next to the badge. |
| Twitter handle      | `agorastoryverse`                                         | `agorastoryverse`                                                                                        |
| Discord invite ID   | numeric ID `1315240114691248138` + invite code `rp4Qr8cA` | same as existing services                                                                                |

The codecov graph token is **public** — it only controls badge/graph rendering, not repo
access. Safe to commit. The private upload token lives in CI secrets, never in docs.

### 1.3 Required for SECURITY.md

| Input                       | Example                                | Default                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Org / project display label | `A-Novel` (used in running prose)      | `A-Novel`                              |
| Security contact email      | `geoffroy.vincent@agorastoryverse.com` | `geoffroy.vincent@agorastoryverse.com` |

### 1.4 Required for CONTRIBUTING.md

| Input                | Example                                       | Default                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Project slug         | `service-json-keys`                           | (ask — used in page title)                    |
| Org contributing URL | `a-novel/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md` | `a-novel/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md` |

### 1.5 Capability flags (shape template output)

Ask the user which of these apply. Each flag turns a section of README/CONTRIBUTING on or
off:

| Flag               | What it enables                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `has-grpc`         | gRPC compose examples + `grpcurl` interaction snippets              |
| `has-rest`         | REST compose examples + `curl` interaction snippets                 |
| `has-standalone`   | Standalone (all-in-one) image in addition to split images           |
| `has-go-client`    | `pkg/go` usage example in README, Go client section in CONTRIBUTING |
| `has-js-client`    | `pkg/js` usage example in README, JS client section in CONTRIBUTING |
| `has-openapi-docs` | Link to GitHub Pages docs in README + redocly/scalar mention        |
| `has-cron-jobs`    | Scheduled-job section (like rotate-keys) in CONTRIBUTING            |

When an input is unknown or the user declines to provide it, insert an HTML TODO comment
(see [Handling Missing Values](#handling-missing-values)) rather than guessing or leaving
the field blank.

---

## Phase 2: Detect Scaffold vs. Update

```bash
ls README.md SECURITY.md CONTRIBUTING.md 2>/dev/null
```

- File missing → scaffold mode: generate from template in Phase 4
- File present → update mode: read it first, edit the relevant section only (Phase 5)

Never overwrite an existing file with the full template. Users may have added custom
sections (architecture diagrams, org-specific footers, release notes) that are not in the
template — replacing the file silently drops them.

---

## Phase 3: Handling Missing Values

When an input is required but not available, write an HTML TODO comment at the exact
location where the value belongs. Format:

```markdown
<!-- TODO(project-docs): <what is missing> — <where to get it> -->
```

HTML comments do not render in GitHub's Markdown preview, so the file still looks clean to
visitors, but grep finds them instantly:

```bash
grep -rn "TODO(project-docs)" .
```

Examples:

```markdown
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/a-novel/service-json-keys/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/a-novel/service-json-keys) <!-- TODO(project-docs): add ?token=<graph-token> from codecov.io/gh/a-novel/service-json-keys/settings > Badge if a tokenized badge is required -->
```

```markdown
Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at <!-- TODO(project-docs): security contact email -->.
```

**Do not** invent values. A fake email or a placeholder like `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` that a
reader might mistake for real content is worse than a visible TODO.

---

## Phase 4: Scaffold Templates

All three templates below use `{{variable}}` placeholders. Substitute every placeholder
with the inputs from Phase 1 before writing the file. Do not leave `{{…}}` in the output
— unresolved placeholders are a bug.

### 4.1 README.md template

```markdown
# {{project-display-name}}

[![X (formerly Twitter) Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/{{twitter-handle}})](https://twitter.com/{{twitter-handle}})
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/{{discord-id}}?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/{{discord-invite-code}})

![Coverage graph](https://codecov.io/gh/{{repo-path}}/graphs/sunburst.svg) <!-- TODO(project-docs): if this repo requires a tokenized Codecov sunburst, append `?token=<codecov-graph-token>` to the image URL above -->

## Usage

<!-- Include the sub-sections below only when the corresponding capability flag is set. -->

### Docker

<!-- If has-grpc: include the gRPC compose block(s). -->
<!-- If has-rest: include the REST compose block(s). -->
<!-- If has-standalone: include both the standalone and split-image variants for each protocol. -->

Above are the minimal required configuration to run the service locally. Configuration is
done through environment variables. Below is a list of available configurations:

**Required variables**

| Name | Description | Images |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |

<!-- One row per required env var. -->

**Optional variables**

<!-- Group by concern: REST API, Logs & Tracing, etc. One table per group. -->

<!-- If has-js-client: include the JS/npm usage section. -->
<!-- If has-go-client: include the Go module usage section. -->
```

**README section guidance:**

- The nine entries in the catalog (two socials + three repo metrics + four CI/coverage,
  counting the Codecov sunburst) always appear in the order shown. Deviating breaks the
  visual rhythm across services.
- The `<hr />` literal (not `---`) separates the social badges from the repo metrics — this
  matches the existing Agora convention.
- Docker compose examples must pin images by tag (e.g., `:v2.2.6`), never `:latest`. When
  scaffolding, ask the user for the current release version or write a
  `<!-- TODO(project-docs): current image tag (see GitHub releases) -->` placeholder.
- The config-vars tables use `<br/>` to stack multiple image names in a single cell —
  keeps the table narrow.
- Client usage snippets should demonstrate the **minimum viable call** (ping + one real
  operation), not every available method. Readers will find the rest in the API reference.

### 4.2 SECURITY.md template

This file is near-boilerplate. Only `{{org-label}}` and `{{security-email}}` are
substituted. Do not rewrite the boilerplate to "improve" it — consistency across Agora
services matters more than prose polish.

```markdown
# Security Policies and Procedures

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the `{{org-label}}`
project.

- [Reporting a Bug](#reporting-a-bug)
- [Disclosure Policy](#disclosure-policy)
- [Comments on this Policy](#comments-on-this-policy)

### 4.3 CONTRIBUTING.md template

````markdown
# Contributing to {{project-slug}}

Welcome to the {{project-display-name}} for the A-Novel platform. This guide will help you understand the codebase, set
up your development environment, and contribute effectively.

Before reading this guide, if you haven't already, please check the
[generic contribution guidelines](https://github.com/{{org-contributing-url}}) that are relevant
to your scope.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

The following must be installed on your system.

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
- (optional) [Direnv](https://direnv.net/)
- Make
  - `sudo apt-get install build-essential` (apt)
  - `sudo pacman -S make` (arch)
  - `brew install make` (macOS)
  - [Make for Windows](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

### Bootstrap

Install the dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

### Common Commands

| Command         | Description                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `make run`      | Start all services locally       |
| `make test`     | Run all tests                    |
| `make lint`     | Run all linters                  |
| `make format`   | Format all code                  |
| `make build`    | Build Docker images locally      |
| `make generate` | Generate mocks and protobuf code |

### Interacting with the Service

<!-- If has-rest: include REST interaction snippets (curl). -->
<!-- If has-grpc: include gRPC interaction snippets (grpcurl). -->

---

## Project-Specific Guidelines

> This section contains patterns specific to this {{project-display-name}}.

<!-- TODO(project-docs): document the project-specific patterns — typical sections:
     - domain concepts (what the service owns / produces)
     - lifecycle of the primary entity (states, transitions)
     - key configuration files and what they control
     - scheduled jobs / cron
     - gRPC services table (if has-grpc)
     - REST API overview (if has-rest)
     - client packages (if has-go-client / has-js-client)
-->

---

## Questions?

If you have questions or run into issues:

- Open an issue at https://github.com/{{repo-path}}/issues
- Check existing issues for similar problems
- Include relevant logs and environment details
````

**CONTRIBUTING section guidance:**

- The **Quick Start** and **Questions** sections are identical across all Agora services.
  Do not customize them per project — that creates drift.
- The **Interacting with the Service** section varies only by protocol (REST vs. gRPC).
  Use the capability flags to include/exclude snippets.
- The **Project-Specific Guidelines** section is bespoke. The template leaves a TODO
  comment listing common sub-sections (domain concepts, lifecycle, config, etc.) — the
  user fills these in based on the project. Do not invent content.

---

## Phase 5: Update Mode

When one of the three files already exists, `Read` it first, then `Edit` the specific
section that needs changing. Do not rewrite the file.

### Typical update operations

| Request                                | Action                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Bump the Docker image tags in README" | Edit every `image: ghcr.io/.../…:vX.Y.Z` line to the new version                                   |
| "Add env var FOO to README"            | Add a new row to the matching config-vars table                                                    |
| "Change security contact"              | Edit `{{security-email}}` occurrence in SECURITY.md                                                |
| "New gRPC service added"               | Add row to the gRPC services table in CONTRIBUTING.md                                              |
| "Project got a JS client"              | Add the JS usage section to README, add JS client section to CONTRIBUTING, flip `has-js-client` on |
| "Remove deprecated ENV var"            | Delete the table row in README; surface to user since removal may be breaking                      |

### Update rules

- **Preserve unknown content.** If the file has sections you don't recognize (custom
  architecture notes, team-specific tips), leave them untouched.
- **One logical edit per call.** When adding a new env var, update only that table; do not
  also "touch up" unrelated sections while there.
- **Check for stale cross-references.** Adding a new gRPC service to the CONTRIBUTING
  table means the README's service list (if any) needs the same row.
- **Version bumps touch every occurrence.** A release bump affects every compose YAML in
  the README — use `Edit` with `replace_all` only when you have verified the old string is
  unique to the version (e.g., `:v2.2.6`), otherwise do it one-by-one.

---

## Badge Catalog

Copy these patterns verbatim — the exact URL format matters (shields.io is strict about
path segments). Parameters are clearly marked with `{{…}}`.

| Badge                    | Markdown pattern                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Twitter follow           | `[![X (formerly Twitter) Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/{{twitter-handle}})](https://twitter.com/{{twitter-handle}})`     |
| Discord                  | `[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/{{discord-id}}?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/{{discord-invite-code}})`                   |
| Go version (from go.mod) | `![GitHub go.mod Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/{{repo-path}})`                                             |
| File count               | `![GitHub repo file or directory count](https://img.shields.io/github/directory-file-count/{{repo-path}})`                               |
| Code size                | `![GitHub code size in bytes](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/code-size/{{repo-path}})`                                          |
| CI workflow status       | `![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/{{repo-path}}/{{main-workflow-file}})`          |
| Go Report Card           | `[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/{{repo-path}})](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/{{repo-path}})` |
| Codecov badge            | Default (no token): `[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/{{repo-path}}/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/{{repo-path}})` — add `?token={{codecov-graph-token}}` to the badge URL only when the repo requires a tokenized variant |
| Codecov sunburst         | Default (no token): `![Coverage graph](https://codecov.io/gh/{{repo-path}}/graphs/sunburst.svg)` — add `?token={{codecov-graph-token}}` to the image URL only when a tokenized variant is required                                  |

**Codecov graph token — not a secret.** It is the public badge token from
`codecov.io/gh/<repo>/settings > Badge`. Committing it is intentional. The private upload
token (used by the CI `report-codecov` job) lives in repo secrets, never here.

---

## Portability to New Projects

This skill lives in this repo's `.claude/skills/write-project-docs/`. To reuse it in a new
Agora service:

1. Copy the directory into the new repo's `.claude/skills/`:

   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/this-repo/.claude/skills/write-project-docs \
         /path/to/new-repo/.claude/skills/
   ```

2. In the new repo, invoke the skill (Claude picks it up once the file exists). Phase 1
   will collect the new project's inputs.

3. The templates are intentionally Agora-flavoured (mentions of `make` targets, podman,
   `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.). That is a feature, not a bug — it keeps docs consistent
   across services. When a new project legitimately deviates (different tooling, different
   org), update the templates in place rather than forking them.

---

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not edit `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.** It's the Contributor Covenant verbatim. Changes to
  it are org-wide policy, not per-repo.
- **Do not add "Live Demo" / "Screenshots" / "Roadmap" sections** unless the user asks.
  They become stale fast and aren't in the Agora template.
- **Do not write long prose.** README and CONTRIBUTING are reference documents. Tables,
  bullet lists, and runnable code blocks beat paragraphs.
- **Do not embed secrets.** The codecov graph token is fine (public). API keys, passwords,
  real `APP_MASTER_KEY` values, npm auth tokens are not.
- **Do not link to internal-only dashboards.** Anything linked in the README is
  publicly visible once the repo is public.
- **Do not invent version numbers or email addresses** to fill placeholders. Use the TODO
  comment pattern.
