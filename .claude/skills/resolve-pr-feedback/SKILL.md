description: >
  Survey a pull request's combined state (CI + review threads + reviewer status) and work through
  reviewer feedback for Agora backend services. Use this skill whenever checking on an open PR
  ("what's the state of PR X", "look at the CI and comments on 123", "monitor PR 532"), reading
  Copilot or human review comments, deciding whether to accept a suggestion, replying on a thread,
  resolving a thread after a fix, starting your own thread to flag a concern, or re-requesting
  review after changes. Always invoke it when the user mentions PR review comments, a reviewer's
  name, a failing check on an open PR, or asks anything that involves reading + responding to
  feedback on a pull request — even if the word "resolve" is not used. Pairs with git-conventions
  (for the format of review-driven fix commits).

# Resolve PR Feedback

This skill governs how Claude surveys a pull request's state and works through reviewer
feedback. It is called both as a passive read ("check PR 532") and as an active workflow
("address the comments on PR 532"). Both modes share Phase 1; only the resolve workflow
continues through Phases 2–5.

---

## Guiding principle

A pull request is a **conversation**, not a checklist. Reviewers — human or bot — can be
right, wrong, unclear, or working from a partial picture of the change. Apply judgment,
not obedience. The failure modes are symmetric: silently overriding a valid concern
erodes trust; blindly applying an incorrect suggestion ships a regression. In both cases
the remedy is the same — speak on the thread so the reviewer sees your reasoning and
can push back.

Three rules anchor the loop. Everything else in this skill is the mechanics behind them:

1. **Accepted and pushed → resolve the thread.** A thread with a fix applied and no
   resolution is noise that forces reviewers to hunt for the change.
2. **Declined → reply with a reason, do not resolve.** The reviewer gets the next move.
   They may agree and resolve themselves, or push back with context you did not have.
3. **Unsure → reply with a specific question, wait for the next round.** Silence is the
   worst option; acting on partial understanding is the second-worst.

If you partially accepted, took a different direction, or bundled the fix with adjacent
changes, the **reply explains the deviation** before any thread is resolved. Quiet,
after-the-fact re-interpretation is what erodes trust.

---

## Phase 1: Survey PR state

Callable on its own. When the user asks only to "check", "look at", or "monitor" a PR,
run this phase, report back, and stop. Do not proceed to action without explicit
go-ahead.

### 1.1 Read the PR envelope

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json \
  number,state,isDraft,mergeable,reviewDecision,baseRefName,headRefName,title,commits,reviews
```

Fields that matter:

- **state**: OPEN / CLOSED / MERGED. Never act on non-OPEN PRs without confirmation —
  reopening a closed discussion is a different kind of decision.
- **isDraft**: draft PRs rarely need the full review-cycle. If the reviewer left
  comments anyway, confirm with the user whether they want them addressed now.
- **reviewDecision**: APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED / REVIEW_REQUIRED. Shapes what
  Phase 5 looks like.
- **baseRefName** / **headRefName**: you almost always land fixes as new commits on
  `headRefName`. Force-push with `--force-with-lease` only if a rebase was required.

### 1.2 Read review comments

GitHub splits review feedback across three endpoints. You need all three to see the
full picture — a comment in one does not show up in the others.

**Inline review comments** (anchored to `file:line`):

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments
```

Each record has `id`, `path`, `line`, `body`, `user.login`, `in_reply_to_id`, `commit_id`.
The `id` here is the REST comment ID — not the GraphQL thread node ID used for
resolution (see 1.3).

**Top-level PR comments** (the "Conversation" tab, not anchored to code):

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/comments
```

**Review envelopes** (APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED / COMMENTED wrappers that group
inline comments):

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/reviews
```

A single review envelope can contain zero or many inline comments and a top-level body.
Read all three endpoints when surveying.

### 1.3 Read thread resolution state

The REST API does not expose whether a review thread is resolved. Use GraphQL:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!, $threadCursor:String) {
  repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
    pullRequest(number:$number) {
      reviewThreads(first:100, after:$threadCursor) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          isOutdated
          comments(first:50) {
            pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
            nodes { databaseId author{login} path line body url }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -F owner=<owner> -F repo=<repo> -F number=<number>
```

The `id` returned here is the **thread node ID** — distinct from the REST `comment.id`.
You need it for Phase 5.2 to resolve the thread. Save it.

`reviewThreads(first:100)` and `comments(first:50)` cover the vast majority of PRs, but
long-lived or high-traffic PRs can exceed either limit. The authoritative truncation
signal is `pageInfo.hasNextPage`; pagination is **two-level** because GraphQL cursors
are scoped to the specific connection instance that produced them:

1. **Outer — threads.** If `reviewThreads.pageInfo.hasNextPage` is `true`, re-issue the
   query above with `-F threadCursor=<endCursor>` and loop until it is `false`.
2. **Inner — comments on a specific thread.** Each thread exposes its own
   `comments.pageInfo`. If a thread reports `comments.pageInfo.hasNextPage == true`,
   that thread's `endCursor` is meaningful **only for that thread** — it cannot be
   reused across threads. Paginate per-thread via a `node(id:)` follow-up, using the
   `thread.id` saved above:

   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='
   query($threadId:ID!, $cursor:String) {
     node(id:$threadId) {
       ... on PullRequestReviewThread {
         comments(first:50, after:$cursor) {
           pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
           nodes { databaseId author{login} path line body url }
         }
       }
     }
   }' -F threadId=<thread-node-id> -F cursor=<endCursor>
   ```

(An exact-100 or exact-50 result count can coincidentally match the page size, so it is
a weaker heuristic than `hasNextPage` — treat it as a hint to check, not a signal on its
own.) Missing a thread or a comment at survey time means silently missing feedback
during classification, which is the worst failure mode for this phase.

`isOutdated: true` means the comment anchored to code that has since changed; the
reviewer's concern may already be addressed by a later push. Confirm before closing.

### 1.4 Read CI state

```bash
gh pr checks <number>
```

CI failures are feedback too. When a CI failure overlaps with a reviewer's concern (same
lint rule, same missing test, same typo), fold the fix into the thread response so the
reviewer can see it addressed in one place. For isolated CI failures — or anything that
needs flake-vs-real classification — hand off to `monitor-ci` when that skill is on
master (pending, tracked in #533). Until then, summarize the failing checks to the user
and ask how they want to proceed.

### 1.5 Report the survey

When invoked as a standalone check, report in this shape:

- **Summary line**: state, review decision, CI status, mergeability.
- **Unresolved threads**: one line per thread — `path:line — reviewer — excerpt` — plus
  the thread node ID so the user can act on it later.
- **Failing CI checks**: name + link.
- **New commits since last review**: short-SHA + subject.

Stop here. Do not begin classifying or replying without the user's go-ahead.

---

## Phase 2: Classify each unresolved thread

For every unresolved thread, fit it into one of four buckets. Read the full thread
(including prior replies), read the code it points at, and reason about each thread
independently — do not classify in bulk.

| Bucket                    | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accept**                | The comment is correct and actionable; a straightforward change implements its intent.                                                                                                                           |
| **Accept-with-deviation** | The core concern is valid but the specific suggestion is wrong, partial, or better served by a different approach.                                                                                               |
| **Decline**               | The comment misunderstands the change, conflicts with a repo guideline (CLAUDE.md, a skill file, a documented decision), would reintroduce a security or correctness regression, or is out of scope for this PR. |
| **Unsure**                | You cannot confidently place the comment into one of the above.                                                                                                                                                  |

Signals that push toward **decline** specifically:

- Accepting would violate a rule in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — the skill file is the
  authoritative source, not the comment.
- The comment asks to re-expose something that was deliberately hidden for security
  (e.g., error strings on an unauthenticated endpoint). Treat that as a decline, not a
  conversation.
- The comment asks for feature work outside this PR's layer or scope. The right answer
  is usually "decline for this PR, file a follow-up."

Signals that push toward **unsure**:

- The comment assumes context you do not see in the PR (e.g., references an incident,
  a prior decision, or code in another repo).
- Two readings of the comment would lead to different fixes, and the reviewer did not
  pick one.
- The comment is terse ("this won't work") with no specifics.

**Bots vs humans.** Copilot and similar bots do not re-engage on thread replies. Still
classify their comments with the same rigor — bots miss context routinely, and blanket
acceptance is how insecure or incorrect changes land. Weight your reply toward the
**human** reviewer who will read the thread later.

A bot repeating the same claim across several comments is **not** independent evidence
of correctness; it is one opinion with a megaphone. Verify the underlying fact once —
official docs, a spec, or an empirical test (the latter is often one `gh api` call
away) — and cite that source in your reply. Treating repetition as confirmation is how
a confidently wrong bot propagates an error from the review into the codebase.

Bots are especially prone to confident errors about **external specs** — API endpoint
paths, header names, status code semantics, protocol details. When a comment asserts a
factual claim about a third-party system, the correct first move is to check that
system's authoritative source, not to argue from plausibility.

---

## Phase 3: Act on each thread

Work the cheap replies first (decline, unsure) before the code changes (accept,
accept-with-deviation). That gets the conversation moving while you focus on the fixes.

### 3.1 Decline

Reply once, inline on the thread, with:

- A one-sentence reason.
- A pointer to the authoritative source when one exists (skill file, CLAUDE.md section,
  linked incident, standard).
- An invitation to push back if more context would change the assessment.

Do **not** resolve the thread. The reviewer gets the next move: they may agree and
resolve, or push back with new information — in which case you re-enter Phase 2 on the
same thread.

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
  -f body="$(cat <<'EOF'
<one-sentence reason>

Per <.claude/skills/...-SKILL.md section / CLAUDE.md anchor / linked source>.
Happy to revisit if I've missed context here.
EOF
)"
```

### 3.2 Unsure — start a discussion

Reply with a **specific question**, not a generic "what do you mean?". Quote the part
you are unsure about and lay out the interpretations you see. This respects the
reviewer's time and anchors the next round.

Wait for a reply before acting. Re-enter Phase 2 once the reviewer responds; multi-round
exchanges on a single thread are normal.

### 3.3 Accept-with-deviation

Apply the fix in the direction that actually makes sense (Phase 4). After pushing,
reply **explaining the deviation** before any resolution:

- "Took the core suggestion but scoped it to X instead of Y — Y would also touch the
  Z layer, which is out of scope for this branch."
- "Applied the spirit of the comment via <alternative> — the literal suggestion would
  not work because <reason>."

Whether to resolve depends on how far you deviated. Small, well-explained deviations
can be resolved; larger ones should stay open so the reviewer can accept the alternative
or push back. **When in doubt, leave it open.**

### 3.4 Accept

Apply the fix (Phase 4). After pushing, reply with a one-liner:

- `Fixed in <short-sha>.`
- Optional: one sentence on anything non-obvious about how you applied it.

Resolve the thread.

---

## Phase 4: Apply fixes and push

### 4.1 Commit per `git-conventions`

One logical unit per commit. Pick the commit type that matches the change itself, not
the reviewer's category:

- Reviewer asked for a test → `test(<scope>): ...`
- Reviewer asked for a doc or description clarification → `docs(<scope>): ...`
- Reviewer flagged a real bug → `fix(<scope>): ...`
- Reviewer asked for a rename or internal reshape → `refactor(<scope>): ...`

Cite the review in the commit body so the log is self-documenting:

```
Addresses <reviewer-login> review feedback on #<PR-number>.
```

**Never amend a pushed commit to address review.** The review is anchored to the old
SHA; amending rewrites shared history and strands the review thread's context. Always
create new commits. (This is a hard rule from `git-conventions`.)

### 4.2 Run the narrowest test target

After each logical change, before pushing:

- Go internal changes → `make test-unit`
- `pkg/go` changes → `make test-pkg`
- `pkg/js` changes → `make test-pkg-js`

Never push a red tree.

### 4.3 Push

```bash
git push
```

If the fix required a rebase, use `git push --force-with-lease`. Never plain `--force`,
never force-push to `master`.

---

## Phase 5: Close the loop

### 5.1 Reply on every addressed thread

Even threads you resolve get a one-line reply. The reply is the audit trail — the
resolve button alone leaves reviewers guessing which commit addressed which comment.
For declines and deviations, the reply is the whole point; the resolution (if any)
follows from it.

Use the inline reply endpoint — top-level PR comments do **not** thread with inline
review comments:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
  -f body="Fixed in <short-sha>."
```

### 5.2 Resolve accepted threads

Only accepted threads (3.3 small deviations and 3.4 clean accepts) get resolved by
Claude. Declines stay open for the reviewer.

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($id:ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}) {
    thread { id isResolved }
  }
}' -F id=<thread-node-id>
```

The `thread-node-id` comes from the Phase 1.3 GraphQL response — not the REST comment
ID.

### 5.3 Re-request review

Only after:

- Every accepted fix has been pushed.
- CI is green (hand off to `monitor-ci` while it runs if that skill is available on
  master — pending, tracked in #533 — otherwise watch `gh pr checks <n>` manually).
- Any decline replies have been posted so the reviewer has context when they look again.

Then:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/requested_reviewers \
  -X POST -F 'reviewers[]=<reviewer-login>'
```

Note the `reviewers[]=...` syntax: `gh api` sends `-f` and `-F` values as scalar strings
by default (or, for `-F`, does type inference only on literal `true`/`false`/`null`/ints).
Neither `-f reviewers='["alice"]'` nor `-F reviewers='["alice"]'` produces a JSON array —
both send a string. The documented way to build an array is repeated `key[]=value`
entries, one per element; the GitHub API then receives an actual `reviewers: [...]`
payload.

Re-requesting mid-exchange, while declines are unresolved, or with failing CI burns
reviewer attention and signals carelessness. Don't.

---

## Starting your own thread

The skill is not just defensive. Claude may initiate a thread when:

- Applying a fix surfaces an adjacent concern that deserves discussion — either on the
  same line, or at the top level for cross-cutting issues.
- A decision taken in the PR is non-obvious and the commit message alone won't reach
  future readers.
- An assumption needs reviewer confirmation before another round.

**Inline thread** (anchored to a line on the current head commit):

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments \
  -f body="..." \
  -f commit_id="<head-sha>" \
  -f path="<file>" \
  -F line=<N> \
  -f side="RIGHT"
```

**Top-level comment** (general discussion, not anchored to code):

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "..."
```

Rule of thumb: inline for anything that points at specific code; top-level for PR-wide
context (e.g., a summary of how a batch of fixes was applied, or a question about the
overall direction).

---

## Common pitfalls

- **Silent resolution without a reply.** Reviewers cannot tell which commit addressed
  the thread — they have to hunt. Always pair a resolve with a reply linking to the SHA.
- **Blanket acceptance of bot comments.** Copilot can be wrong. Classify every comment;
  the failure mode of over-trust is insecure or incorrect code landing in main.
- **Treating repeated bot claims as confirmation.** Three identical comments from one
  bot are one opinion amplified, not three independent signals. Verify the underlying
  fact once against an authoritative source before accepting or declining.
- **Accepting a reviewer's spec claim without checking the spec.** When a comment
  asserts a specific API shape, endpoint path, header name, or protocol detail, verify
  it against the upstream docs — or make a single empirical call — before editing.
  Plausibility is not evidence.
- **Using the wrong endpoint for replies.** Top-level PR comments (`gh pr comment`) do
  not thread with inline review comments. A reply to an inline comment must go through
  `POST /pulls/:n/comments/:id/replies`.
- **Resolving a declined thread.** Declines are the reviewer's move to close, not yours.
  Closing a thread you disagreed with is how review culture breaks down.
- **Amending or force-pushing to address review.** Review comments are anchored to the
  SHA that was reviewed. Rewriting strands them. New commits, every time.
- **Re-requesting review too early.** Wait for all pushes + green CI + posted declines.
- **Acting while unsure.** If the comment is ambiguous, the only correct first move is
  a specific question. Do not apply a best-guess fix and then explain on the thread —
  that wastes a round.
- **Mixing types in one commit to bundle a batch of review fixes.** Each review-driven
  commit is still subject to `git-conventions` — a `test` and a `docs` fix are two
  commits, even when they came from the same review.

---

## Hand-offs

- **From `open-pull-request`** _(skill pending, tracked in #533)_ — once that skill is
  on master, the push-and-open flow hands off here when reviewers comment. Until then,
  enter directly via user request on any already-open PR.
- **To `monitor-ci`** _(skill pending, tracked in #533)_ — for failing checks that need
  flake-vs-real classification or a retry loop. When CI agrees with a reviewer (same
  root cause), fold the fix into the thread response rather than pushing twice.
- **To `git-conventions`** — every review-driven commit. No exceptions.
- **To the layer-specific skills** — `write-go-code`, `write-go-tests`, `write-openapi`,
  `write-js-package`, etc. Phase 4 writes code; those skills govern _how_.
