# JS Package Writing Skill

This skill governs how to write and maintain the TypeScript REST client package at `pkg/js/`.
The package is the public JS surface for the JSON-keys service — it must mirror the OpenAPI spec
exactly and stay synchronized with the REST handlers.

**Before editing any file**, read the file first. Patterns are consistent by design — follow them
exactly. Read the OpenAPI spec (`openapi.yaml`) for every endpoint you touch; the client contract
must match it.

## Package Layout

```
pkg/js/
├── rest/                        # Published npm package (@a-novel/service-json-keys-rest)
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── index.ts             # Re-exports everything — only file consumers import from
│   │   ├── api.ts               # JsonKeysApi class (HTTP plumbing + system endpoints)
│   │   └── <domain>.ts          # One file per resource domain (e.g., jwk.ts)
│   ├── dist/                    # Build artefacts — never edit manually
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json            # Base TypeScript config
│   ├── tsconfig.build.json      # Declaration-only build config
│   └── vite.config.ts           # ES module bundle config
│
└── test/rest/                   # Integration test suite (private, not published)
    ├── src/
    │   ├── api.test.ts          # Tests for JsonKeysApi system endpoints
    │   └── <domain>.test.ts     # One test file per domain (mirrors library files)
    ├── package.json
    └── tsconfig.json
```

New resource domains follow the same split: one `<domain>.ts` source file, one `<domain>.test.ts`
test file. Never merge unrelated domains into a single file.

---

## After Every Edit

Run these two targets before declaring the work done:

```bash
make lint-node      # format (Prettier) + lint (ESLint + TypeScript typecheck)
make test-pkg-js    # integration tests against a live containerised service
```

`make lint-node` covers both formatting and linting — run it first so type errors surface before
running the heavier integration suite.

`make test-pkg-js` orchestrates the full integration environment (container startup, port
allocation, readiness wait) via `scripts/test.pkg.js.sh`. Never run vitest directly for the
integration tests — the script wires up the required environment variables and container lifecycle.

---

## Synchronization Rule

The JS client, the OpenAPI spec (`openapi.yaml`), and the Go REST handlers are three
representations of the same contract. **They must always be changed together.**

When you edit any one of these:

| Changed         | Also update                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAPI spec    | JS client types + methods, Go handlers                         |
| JS client       | OpenAPI spec (verify parity), Go handlers if behaviour changed |
| Go REST handler | OpenAPI spec, JS client                                        |

A PR that updates only one of the three without updating the others must justify the omission
explicitly. Divergence between the spec, the client, and the handlers is a bug.

## Library: `pkg/js/rest/src/`

### `api.ts` — The `JsonKeysApi` Class

`JsonKeysApi` owns all HTTP plumbing. It holds the `_baseUrl` and exposes two primitives:

```typescript
/** Fire-and-forget — discards the response body. Throws on non-2xx. */
async fetchVoid(input: string, init?: RequestInit): Promise<void>

/** JSON response — deserialises body as T. Throws on non-2xx or invalid JSON. */
async fetch<T>(input: string, init?: RequestInit): Promise<T>
```

Domain functions always delegate to one of these two. They never call the global `fetch` directly.

System endpoints (`/ping`, `/healthcheck`) live in `api.ts` as methods on the class. Resource
endpoints (`/jwks`, `/jwk`) live in separate domain files as standalone functions.

Do not add new methods to `JsonKeysApi` for resource endpoints — always add standalone functions
in a domain file instead. The class is intentionally minimal.

### Domain Files (e.g., `jwk.ts`)

Each domain file exports:

- Named type definitions for every request/response shape used in that domain
- Standalone async functions that take `api: JsonKeysApi` as their first argument

Function signatures:

```typescript
export async function jwkList(api: JsonKeysApi, usage?: string): Promise<Jwk[]>;
export async function jwkGet(api: JsonKeysApi, id: string): Promise<Jwk>;
```

**URL construction**: use `URLSearchParams` for query parameters — never interpolate parameters
directly into URL strings.

```typescript
const params = new URLSearchParams();
if (filter) params.set("filter", filter);
const query = params.toString();
return await api.fetch(`/resource${query ? `?${query}` : ""}`, { method: "GET" });
```

**Headers**: use constants from `@a-novel-kit/nodelib-browser/http` — `HTTP_HEADERS.JSON` for
endpoints that return JSON, nothing extra for void responses.

**Request body**: pass serialised JSON as the body with `HTTP_HEADERS.JSON` on POST/PUT/PATCH:

```typescript
return await api.fetch("/resource", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: HTTP_HEADERS.JSON,
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
```

### `index.ts` — Exports

Re-export everything from every domain file and from `api.ts`:

```typescript
export * from "./api";
export * from "./jwk";
```

Never import from a file other than `index.ts` in consumers or tests — always import from the
package root (`@a-novel/service-json-keys-rest`). `index.ts` is the single public surface.

When adding a new domain file, add a corresponding `export * from "./<domain>";` line to
`index.ts`.

### TypeScript Rules

- Strict mode is on. All types must be explicit — no `any`. The `Jwk` type uses
  `[key: string]: unknown` for algorithm-specific fields; that is `unknown`, not `any`.
- Use `type` imports (`import type { ... }`) for types that are only used in type positions.
- Use `interface` for object shapes that may be extended; use `type` for unions, intersections,
  and type aliases.
- ES modules only — no CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`).
- Target: ESNext. No polyfills; the published package targets Node ≥ 23 and modern browsers.

### JSDoc

Every exported type, class, method, and function must have a JSDoc comment. The comment must
explain _what it does and why_, not just restate the name. Include:

- A first-line summary sentence (shown in IDE tooltips).
- Descriptions for every non-obvious parameter.
- A note on error conditions (what HTTP status causes a throw).

```typescript
/**
 * Returns all active public keys for the given usage.
 *
 * A usage identifies a named signing configuration (e.g., `"auth"`, `"auth-refresh"`).
 * Omitting `usage`, or passing an unrecognized value, returns an empty list.
 */
export async function jwkList(api: JsonKeysApi, usage?: string): Promise<Jwk[]>;
```

Do not repeat what is already clear from the type signature alone (e.g., "takes a string and
returns a promise").

## Tests: `pkg/js/test/rest/src/`

### Structure

Tests are integration tests against a live service. There are no unit tests or mocks in this
package — the whole point is to verify the real HTTP contract.

Each test file mirrors a library source file:

| Library file      | Test file                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| `rest/src/api.ts` | `test/rest/src/api.test.ts` |
| `rest/src/jwk.ts` | `test/rest/src/jwk.test.ts` |

### Imports

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";

import { expectStatus } from "@a-novel-kit/nodelib-test/http";
import { JsonKeysApi, jwkGet, jwkList } from "@a-novel/service-json-keys-rest";
```

Always import from the published package name (`@a-novel/service-json-keys-rest`), not from
relative paths. The workspace symlink resolves this during testing.

### Test File Layout

One `describe` block per exported function or class method:

```typescript
describe("jwkList", () => {
  it("returns keys for a known usage", async () => { ... });
  it("returns an empty list when usage is omitted", async () => { ... });
  it("returns an empty list for an unrecognized usage", async () => { ... });
  it("filters by usage", async () => { ... });
});

describe("jwkGet", () => {
  it("returns 400 for invalid ID format", async () => { ... });
  it("returns 404 for non-existent key", async () => { ... });
  it("retrieves an existing key by ID", async () => { ... });
});
```

Test names use plain sentences, not the `"Success"` / `"Error/X"` convention used in Go tests.
Describe the observable behaviour: `"returns keys for a known usage"`, `"returns 404 for non-existent key"`.

### Instantiation

Always construct `JsonKeysApi` from `process.env.REST_URL!` — this is set by the test script:

```typescript
const api = new JsonKeysApi(process.env.REST_URL!);
```

Never hard-code URLs, ports, or base paths.

### Test Environment Usages

The integration test container runs `rotate-keys` at startup, seeding keys for the two default
usages defined in `internal/config/jwks.config.yaml`:

- `"auth"` — short-lived access token keys (EdDSA)
- `"auth-refresh"` — long-lived refresh token keys (EdDSA)

Tests that need actual key data must pass one of these usages. Calling `jwkList(api)` without a
usage always returns `[]` because the server queries `WHERE usage = ""`.

### Asserting Success

For void responses:

```typescript
await expect(api.ping()).resolves.toBeUndefined();
```

For JSON responses, use a known usage to ensure the live service returns actual data:

```typescript
const keys = await jwkList(api, "auth");
expect(keys.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
for (const key of keys) {
  expect(key.kty).toBeTruthy();
  expect(key.kid).toBeTruthy();
}
```

When testing a retrieve-by-id operation, first list with a known usage to get a real ID:

```typescript
const keys = await jwkList(api, "auth");
expect(keys.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
const key = await jwkGet(api, keys[0].kid);
expect(key.kid).toBe(keys[0].kid);
```

Do not guard with early returns like `if (keys.length === 0) return` after seeding keys via a
known usage — those guard clauses silently skip all assertions if the container failed to seed,
hiding real failures. Assert `length > 0` explicitly.

### Asserting HTTP Errors

Use `expectStatus` from `@a-novel-kit/nodelib-test/http` for expected HTTP error codes:

```typescript
await expectStatus(jwkGet(api, "not-a-uuid"), 400);
await expectStatus(jwkGet(api, "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"), 404);
```

Do not use `try/catch` with manual status inspection — `expectStatus` is the canonical way.

### What to Test

For every exported function, cover:

- The happy path (valid input, expected response shape)
- Each documented error case (400 bad request, 404 not found, etc.)
- Optional parameters: one test with the parameter absent, one with it set (when filtering changes
  the result meaningfully)

Do not test internal implementation details (URL construction, header names). Test the observable
contract: what goes in, what comes out, which HTTP errors are surfaced.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Importing from relative paths in tests.** Tests must import from `@a-novel/service-json-keys-rest`,
  not from `../../rest/src/...`. The workspace symlink is the integration point being tested.
- **Running vitest directly.** Always use `make test-pkg-js` — running `pnpm test` alone skips
  container setup and the tests will fail due to missing `REST_URL`.
- **Adding a new domain file without updating `index.ts`.** Every new file must be re-exported
  from `index.ts` or consumers will not see it.
- **Diverging from the OpenAPI spec.** URL paths, query parameter names, response field names, and
  HTTP methods must match the spec exactly. If the spec says `GET /jwks?usage=...`, the client
  must use `GET /jwks?usage=...`.
- **Calling global `fetch` directly.** Domain functions must always go through `api.fetch` or
  `api.fetchVoid`. Direct `fetch` calls bypass base-URL composition and error handling.
- **Skipping JSDoc on exported symbols.** Every public export needs a JSDoc comment — the
  published package is consumed by other services, and IDE tooltips are the first line of
  documentation.
- **Using `any` types.** Never use `any` in this package. The `Jwk` type carries an
  `[key: string]: unknown` index signature for algorithm-specific fields — that is `unknown`,
  not `any`. Everywhere else, types must be fully explicit.
