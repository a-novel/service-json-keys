  Plan and implement features for Agora backend services using a layered branch strategy.
  Use whenever asked to add, change, or remove any capability — new API endpoints, schema
  changes, business logic, client updates. Covers the full lifecycle from triage to final
  commit, including how to propose a plan, decompose into branches, test each branch, and
  handle backtracking.

# Feature Implementation Workflow

This skill governs how Claude plans and delivers features in Agora backend services. Every
non-trivial change goes through the same four phases: **Assess → Plan → Implement → Validate**.
Each phase has a gate before proceeding.

---

## Phase 0: Before Writing Any Code

**Clarify ambiguous requests first.** If the request is broad ("improve the service", "refactor
this area") or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask one focused question before reading any code.
A plan built on a misunderstood requirement wastes both read and write effort.

**Read the code that will change.** Never guess at signatures, error types, or interfaces. Before
proposing a plan, read:

- The production files in every affected layer
- The test files for those layers (they document the contract)
- Any SQL migrations that the change builds on

Do not propose a plan based on assumptions. If you are unsure which files are involved, use Grep
and Glob to find them.

---

## Phase 1: Assess

Answer these questions before proposing anything:

### What layers does this touch?

Trace the change from data to API surface. For each layer, decide: **must change**, **may
change**, or **not affected**.

| Layer           | Must change if…                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Schema          | The data model gains, loses, or changes columns/tables       |
| DAO             | The database query changes or a new query is needed          |
| Services        | Business logic changes, new error cases, new orchestration   |
| Handlers (gRPC) | A new RPC is added or an existing one changes behaviour      |
| Handlers (REST) | A new endpoint is added or an existing one changes behaviour |
| Proto           | A gRPC message or service interface changes                  |
| OpenAPI         | A REST endpoint contract changes                             |
| pkg/go          | The exported client API changes                              |

### Does it break anything?

A change is breaking if it would cause existing callers to fail without code changes on their side.
Flag these explicitly — they require a BREAKING CHANGE commit footer and a warning to the developer.

Breaking changes include:

- Removing or renaming a protobuf field, message, or service
- Removing or renaming an exported symbol in `pkg/go`
- Removing a REST endpoint or changing its URL/method
- Changing a response field type or removing a response field
- Adding a required field to an existing request
- Changing a database column type without a safe migration

**Non-breaking changes** (always prefer these):

- Adding a new optional field to a proto message
- Adding a new endpoint alongside existing ones
- Adding a new service method
- Adding a new migration column with a default or nullable

### Is this purely additive or does it modify existing behaviour?

Additive changes (new endpoint, new field, new service) are safe to ship in parallel with existing
code. Modifications (change error mapping, change response shape, fix a bug) may affect existing
callers and need extra care.

---

## Phase 2: Plan

Decompose the feature into **one branch per layer boundary**. A branch is the smallest unit that:

- Compiles on its own
- Passes `make test-unit` (or the appropriate test target)
- Is independently reviewable

**Branch order** follows the dependency chain — always work bottom-up:

```
1. Schema (migration) — nothing else can be written until the schema exists
2. Proto (if gRPC surface changes) — DAO and handlers depend on this
3. DAO — services depend on the DAO interface
4. Services — handlers depend on the service interface
5. Handlers (gRPC + REST) — pkg/go depends on the gRPC handler
6. pkg/go — depends on the gRPC contract
7. OpenAPI / docs — depends on the final REST contract
```

Skip layers that are not affected. A feature that only adds a new service method and handler may
start at step 4.

**When a single branch is enough**: if the feature touches only one layer, creates no migration,
and involves no proto changes, a single branch is appropriate. Improvement rounds (multi-layer
bug fixes, test additions, doc updates, code cleanup) that contain no user-facing behavior change
also stay on a single branch — splitting them would be churn with no review benefit.

**Present the plan to the developer before starting.** Show:

- A numbered list of branches with their name and one-sentence description
- Any breaking changes, flagged explicitly
- Any layers deliberately skipped and why

Wait for explicit approval before creating branch 1.

---

## Phase 3: Implement (per branch)

For each branch in order:

### 3.1 Create the branch

```bash
# From master (independent of other branches)
git checkout master
git checkout -b feat/<area>/<description>

# From a parent branch (depends on earlier branch)
git checkout feat/<parent-area>/<parent-description>
git checkout -b feat/<area>/<description>
```

Branch from master whenever possible. Only branch from a sibling when the work literally cannot
compile without the parent's changes.

### 3.2 Implement

- Read the existing files in the layer before touching them
- Use the relevant skill for the layer:

  | Layer                             | Skill                |
  | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
  | Schema / SQL                      | `write-sql`          |
  | Proto                             | `write-proto`        |
  | DAO, services, handlers, lib, cmd | `write-go-code`      |
  | Tests (all layers)                | `write-go-tests`     |
  | OpenAPI / docs                    | `write-openapi`      |
  | Dockerfiles                       | `write-dockerfiles`  |
  | Shell scripts                     | `write-bash-scripts` |
  | Git operations                    | `git-conventions`    |

- **After any proto or interface change, run `make generate`** to regenerate protobuf Go bindings
  and mocks. Commit the generated files (`internal/models/proto/gen/`, `internal/handlers/mocks/`)
  in the same commit as the change that necessitated them — never in a separate cleanup commit.
- **Only change what the feature requires.** No refactoring, no style fixes, no "while we're here"
  improvements alongside feature work. Those are separate commits on a separate branch.
- Keep diffs small and reviewable. A handler + its test + the mock update = one commit.

### 3.3 Test

Run the narrowest target that covers the changed layer:

```bash
make test-unit   # DAO, services, handlers, lib
make test-pkg    # pkg/go (requires running service)
```

Tests must pass before declaring the branch ready. Never mark a branch done with failing tests.

### 3.4 Commit

Follow `git-conventions`. One commit per logical unit within the branch:

- Migration file → one commit
- DAO file + its test → one commit
- Service file + its test → one commit
- Handler file + its test + mock update → one commit

```bash
git add <specific files>
git commit -m "feat(dao): add revoke repository"
```

### 3.5 Wait for developer approval

**Do not proceed to the next branch until the developer says the current one is ready.** Present:

- A brief description of what changed
- The test result
- Any decisions made (e.g., "I chose to add ErrJwkRevokeNotFound rather than reuse ErrJwkDeleteNotFound because…")
- Any open questions or deferred work

---

## Phase 4: Backtracking

If the developer requests a change to branch N after branch N+1 (or later) is already open:

```bash
# 1. Return to the parent branch
git checkout feat/<parent-area>/<description>

# 2. Make the change and commit it
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix(<area>): <what changed>"

# 3. Rebase the child branch onto the updated parent
git checkout feat/<child-area>/<description>
git rebase feat/<parent-area>/<description>

# Resolve any conflicts, then continue
git rebase --continue
```

If more than one child branch depends on the updated parent, rebase them in order (deepest-first
avoids repeated conflict resolution).

Never merge a parent branch into a child — always rebase. Merges add noise to the history and
make the final PR harder to review.

---

## Key Principles

**Chirurgical changes.** Every line changed must be required by the feature. If you find yourself
fixing an unrelated issue, stop: note it as a separate improvement and continue on the feature.

**No side-effects.** Refactoring, style fixes, and "improvements" that are not part of the feature
belong in a separate branch with a separate commit. Mixed changes make PRs hard to review and
bisect.

**Additive over destructive.** Prefer adding new fields, methods, and endpoints over removing or
changing existing ones. When removal is unavoidable, mark it `BREAKING CHANGE` and flag it to the
developer.

**One concern per commit.** A commit should answer exactly one "what changed?" question. If you
cannot describe a commit in a single conventional-commit line, it contains more than one concern.

**Test every branch.** `make test-unit` must pass on every branch, not just the final one. A
branch that compiles but fails tests is not ready for review.

**Verify before proposing.** Never propose a plan based on assumed file locations or signatures.
Read the code first. A plan built on wrong assumptions wastes the developer's review time.

## Quick Reference: Feature Triage

| Signal                                | Implication                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| "Add a new RPC/endpoint"              | Proto → handler → pkg/go (at minimum)             |
| "Add a new column / store new data"   | Migration → DAO → service (at minimum)            |
| "Change what an existing API returns" | Potential breaking change — flag it               |
| "Remove something"                    | Breaking change — get explicit developer approval |
| "Internal only, no API change"        | Services/lib only, single branch likely fine      |
| "Fix a bug in existing behaviour"     | Fix the failing layer; test the contract          |
| "The client should be able to do X"   | Start from pkg/go and trace down to what's needed |
